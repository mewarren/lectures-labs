# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 8
Catch up day. Use this time to catch up with your lab if need be.

Otherwise, use this time to refactor your code and really dig in to understanding it.
Some refactoring ideas:
- perfect your syntax and spacing
- reassess and rename variables, objects, functions, methods
- write functions or loops to make your code less DRY

Submit your assignment through Canvas as usual.
