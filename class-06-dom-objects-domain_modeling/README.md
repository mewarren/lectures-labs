    * [PDXWIT Summer Soiree](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/women-tech-third-annual-summer-soiree-tickets-35269822990) - next Thursday. 
    * [Calagator](http://calagator.org/)
* 1 on 1's w/ SJ: Tuesday - Thursday.

## Learning Objectives
* Translate a problem domain into understandable TODOs and user stories.
* Create a code model for a problem domain using JavaScript objects literals.
* Access and reassign object properties and methods using dot notation and bracket notation.
* Append list items to the DOM using JavaScript.

## Notes
* Domain Modeling and Objects
    * Practice Domain modeling
    * Build an instance of a model with an object literal
        * Properties
        * Methods
    * Accessing and reassigning properties
* The DOM
    * it's a MODEL!!!!!
    * accessing existing elements with JavaScript
    * creating and adding elements with JavaScript
* Today's Lab
    * Yes, I know it's a lot of info to get through, but as a developer, it's now part of your job to translate human to computer. You got this. As always, we encourage you to pair with someone - writing your TODOs and objectives as a pair or mob is a great place to start.
    * lots of repetition, but DON'T COPY PASTE YOUR STORE OBJECTS!!!! Type them out to gain practice 
    of conceptualizing objects and getting familiar with their syntax.
